# Comparing-gospels-NLP
Uses NLP techniques to compare the four different gospel accounts 



The Bible contains four accounts of Jesus' life. These four gospels (ascribed to Mark, Matthew, Luke, and John) tell the story in four different ways, with different audiences and for different purposes. While the main gist of the accounts is the same, there are also significant differences, and at times contradictions, between them. These discrepancies and the relationships between the four gospel accounts have been studied and debated by generations of scholars. These issues are a patent playing field on which to try out Natural Language Processing techniques.

For this NLP analysis, I use the corpus of the World English Bible (web) as available here:
